            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Logan Sargeant became F1’s first American driver in almost eight years as he took to the grid for the 2023 season, giving the country a home favourite to cheer once more.</p>

            <p>A prolific title winner in karting, championship glory eluded Sargeant after he made the transition to single-seater racing, but pole positions and race victories in almost every category he contested underlined his raw speed and potential.</p>

            <p>Indeed, finishing runner-up in F4 UAE, third in British F4 and third in F3 (having also made the podium at the prestigious Macau Grand Prix) showed he could be there or thereabouts in a variety of championships, with plenty of potential still to be untapped.</p>
            
            <p>It also convinced Williams to add the youngster to their books as he reached F2, where more race wins and another top-three classification in 2022 secured the Super Licence points required to complete the journey and graduate to F1 with the Grove team for 2023.</p>
            
            <p>Not since Alexander Rossi’s quintet of appearances with backmarkers Manor at the tail-end of the 2015 season had an American graced the F1 grid, and Sargeant relished changing that across his first season, even if on paper a solitary point was his only reward.</p>

            <p>And with three races in the US now on the Formula 1 calendar – Miami, Austin and Las Vegas – America’s latest F1 star knows he will be spurred on by plenty of home support.</p>
